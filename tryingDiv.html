This distinction comes from studies of African wild dogs and their behavior. In many cases, the female is more dominant than the male and keeps her alpha position for the remainder of her life, whereas the alpha male's position changes often. Beta males tend to compete for the alpha position, especially among large dog packs. Women want men to be alpha when they date to ensure that a man is capable of leading a relationship. We can learn a lot for wild dogs in our dating relationships. Be an Alphadog.";

Especially common in online political slang. The opposite of cringe, some times the opposite of biased. The latter usage is the original use as coined by rapper Lil B, and the word originally took off on the meta-ironic website 4Chan with the latter meaning. For that reason the word is largely used meta-ironically (without context you can't tell if it's being used ironically or sincerely as it's used in both ways) and was popularized in online political slang of conservatives and the political right before being adopted into mainstream online political slang (likely through shitposting websites or subreddits such as r/politicalcompass memes that are similar to 4chan in their meta-irony and 'edginess' but contain a wider variety of political beliefs) and eventually adopted into general online vernacular. When used in online political language it can mean 'based in fact' or the opposite of biased due to the number of people who saw it being first used seriously by the online political right and came to the conclusion that is was related to the phrase 'destroyed with facts and logic' in reference to right wing personality Ben Shapiro.";

The media in the bottom half is most often mobile app gameplay, ASMR videos (such as Kinetic Sand or DIY repair videos) and other types of oddly satisfying visuals. Other than for attention purposes, a secondary video is often added to avoid copyright strikes. Starting in late 2022, the phenomenon became increasingly prevalent online, however, forms of overstimulation content date back to the 2010s on YouTube. In 2022 and 2023, specifically Family Guy and Subway Surfers became standout symbols of the genre, leading to memes such as Boring Ahh Family Guy Episode and the Family Guy Pipeline Incident. Due to the discourse and stigmas surrounding overstimulation videos, parodies ensued that spoofed the visual format, often related to stereotypes about Gen Alpha and Zoomers akin to iPad kid comparisons.";

The phenomenon started on AMP streams in late 2022, spreading via clips on YouTube and TikTok. In late 2023, the phrase Fanum tax became a widely used slang term among Gen Z and Gen Alpha members, resulting in satirical usage that parodied the phrase's over-usage. In October 2023, Fanum tax became associated with the Sticking Out Your Gyat for the Rizzler song, also known as the Fanum Tax song.";
